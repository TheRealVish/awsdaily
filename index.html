                  I started the AWS Daily blog to help anyone interested in AWS learn and be up-to-date with the technology.
                  Also I believe education must be free of cost hence this blog can be used as a resource for AWS Exam prep 
                  or reference for work. I plan to publish a catalogued version of the articles when I complete 100 articles.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So what are my qualifications?<br>
                  <br>
                  I studies MS in computer Science and worked in the software industry for close to couple of decades. Since 
                  the advent of AWS I have been working on projects that helped my clients to migrate or build on AWS. I am 
                  also multi-certified - as of June 2020 I hold AWS solution architect associate and AWS ML speciality certs.
                  I also have good working knowledge in reactJS, reactNative, NodeJS, Python and Golang.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am currently building a fintech product and hope to launch in early 2021.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thanks for visiting, hope the blog is useful.<br>
